# 𝑑𝑅𝐴 : An effective parameter-free comparison of NGS short reads for phylogeny reconstruction

This is the script for dRA : An effective parameter-free comparison of NGS short reads for phylogeny reconstruction

Requirement:
- python3
- sklearn
- usearch

dRA working by searching the most similar alignment pair of each NGS read as query by using USEARCH. Then the dis_cal function will read the search result to measure the evolutionary pair-wise distance.
